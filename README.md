# terminal-differentiation-for-evolutionary-stability

This repository contains code for running and analyzing the simulations described in the biorxiv submission "Integrase-mediated differentiation circuits improve evolutionary stability of burdensome and toxic functions in E. coli" : https://doi.org/10.1101/614529. For a full description of the model implementation, refer to the model implementation section of the supplementary material (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/614529v4.supplementary-material). The folder 'figure1_S1_modeling' contains a Python Jupyter notebook for running the determinstic simulations shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 of the manuscript. The folder 'figure3_S17-26_stochastic_simulations' contains a python code file with all functions used in the running and analysis of the simulations (differentiation_functions_ODE_integrase_mutations_abx_cheating_additive_burden_CIIE_20211129.py), .py files for running the stochastic simulations using command line arguments (naive_stoch_hpc_args.py, diff_stoch_hpc_args.py, diff_select_stoch_hpc_args.py), .sh files used to submit job arrays to an HPC with slurm, and a Python Jupyter notebook used to analyze and plot the results of the stochastic simulations (.pkl files included) shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figures 17-26. Data and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and plotting are in folders organized by figure number.
